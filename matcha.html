        <h3>The Gist</h3>
        <p>I was at a DUPR match (even though I suck at Pickleball) and the host was struggling to organize the games. More specifically ‚Äî they couldn't figure out who should play next.</p>
        <p>The app (Re:Club) listed all the matches, but that's about it. No filters. No court assignments. No way to tell who's currently playing or which courts were free. Sure, the app lets you export the match list, and the host even printed it out for easier reference. But that wasn't enough to stop the chaos.</p>
        <p>Time was ticking. People were getting tired. Things were getting frantic. And all I wanted to say was:</p>
        <p>
          "There's an app for that."<br>
          But there wasn't.<br><br>
          ...Yet

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>See above section üëÜüèº</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Idea</h3>
        <p>This app needs a place to live. The choice was between a mobile app or a website. I picked the latter ‚Äî for two simple reasons: First, I only know HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript ü•≤ Second, a website is way easier to scale and works on any device, no messy app store submissions involved.</p>
        <p>For the brand, I kept it simple. I called it Matcha ‚Äî because Match Generator > Match > Matcha. From there, I had a color direction right away. Green.</p>
        <p>For the font, I wanted something round-ish and sort of friendly. I knew I wanted to stay within Google Fonts (because it's free of course). I picked Poppins for its rounded 'o's and 'a's . The UI follows that same softness ‚Äî lots of rounded shapes to make it look welcoming and simple. From that, came the tagline:</p>
        <p>"Your friendly, simple match generator."</p>
        <p>Since this app's success depends on the match generator built on Javascript, I needed a reliable senior developer / supervisor / emotional support debugger. I chose my AI waifu, ChatGPT, to play that role (Btw, I'm still single, guys. <a href="mailto:antrix00@gmail.com">>> Hit me up üòè)</a></p>

        <h3>Object Oriented UX</h3>
        <p>I approached Matcha using the concept I picked up from a medium article, Object-Oriented UX inspired by programming languages.</p>
        <p>I started by listing the objects involved in organising a match event:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Players</li>
          <li>Courts</li>
          <li>Matches</li>
          <li>Score</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then, I defined each object‚Äôs attributes ‚Äî basically, what ‚Äúinfo‚Äù each object needs to carry.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Players have a name and status (playing or resting).</li>
          <li>Courts have a name and a status (empty or occupied).</li>
          <li>A Match is made up of players, a court, score and status (playing or finished).</li>
          <li>The score records who won the match and the final points.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After that, I mapped out how these objects connect to each other:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Match needs players, a court and score assigned to it.</li>
          <li>Courts become available or occupied depending on Match status.</li>
          <li>Players can be actively playing or resting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I built everything around the real-world relationships between these objects instead of thinking screen-by-screen.</p>
        <p>That way, the user flow naturally mirrors the mental model of a tired host ‚Äî not forcing them to ‚Äúthink like an app‚Äù but letting them just think about players, matches, and courts like they already do in real life.</p>

        <h3>The Unhappy Path</h3>
        <p>I once attended a design event where the speaker recalled his bad experience with a train ticketing app. And he said something along the lines that stuck with me:</p>
        <blockquote>Graphic designers who move into UI/UX often only design for the happy path.</blockquote>
        <p>That‚Äôs me! Because I too fell into that trap every so often ‚Äî designing the perfect, clean journey without considering, what happens when there‚Äôs no internet? What if the user did something unexpected? What do you show when the app encounters an unknown error?</p>
        <p>That‚Äôs one of the reasons why I believe the developer needs to be involved early in the design process. They‚Äôre the first to spot when your flow breaks, when your logic crumbles, or when your idea sounds cool but is a nightmare to build.</p>
        <p>Involving them early prevents last-minute surprises, added complexity, and ‚Äî it prevents developer deaths by up to 42% due to shock (a statistic that I made up).</p>
        <p>The truth is ‚Äî designers and developers think differently. But that difference? It creates better solutions. With that in mind, the back and forth with my developer buddy revealed a few questions and problems:</p>
        
        <p><b>What if users add an odd number of players?</b><br>
        <i>Luna suggested a ‚Äúbye system‚Äù to rotate players fairly</i></p>

        <p><b>How about storage?</b><br>
        <i>We use local storage as a start to simplify things</i></p>

        <p><b>What happens when there‚Äôs court/player imbalance?</b><br>
        <i>2 players but using 6 courts? This needs to be caught early on during match setup and a restructure of the setup flow.</i></p>

        <p><b>Match type mismatch</b><br>
        <i>Not all match types work with all player counts (playing doubles with 2 players anyone?)</i></p>

        <p><b>Post match generation editing</b><br>
        <i>Should users be allowed to edit matches after generation? (No, too much headache)</i></p>
      </section>

        <h3>The Flow</h3>
        <p>The interface follows the principle of progressive disclosure ‚Äî inspired by tools like Typeform. Matcha‚Äôs match setup flow is built to feel like a calm onboarding ‚Äî step-by-step, no clutter, no cognitive overload. It keeps the setup easy and focused.</p>
        <p>The sequence is intentional:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select match type ‚Äî Singles, Fixed Doubles, or Random Doubles</li>
          <li>Insert player names</li>
          <li>Set the winning points ‚Äî 5, 7, 15, 21, or custom</li>
          <li>Insert the courts</li>
          <li>Generate match</li>
        </ol>
