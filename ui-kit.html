      <h1>UI Kit</h1>

      <section>
        <h4>The Gist</h4>
        <p>One of the biggest problems with DPO's internal platforms was inconsistency â€” buttons looked different, inputs behaved differently, and components were being reinvented across every system. Inspired by Atomic Design, I built a UI Kit made up of reusable atoms, molecules, and organisms to bring everything together. It unified the visual language and sped up our workflow â€” like Legos on steroids.</p>
        <p>Timeline: 1 Month - Now (The UI Kit is a constantly growing organism)</p>
        <p>My Role: UI Kit Librarian & Custodian</p>

      <section>
        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>To the credit of the developers, they did use a template as a base. But over time, as more features were piled on, that sleek template slowly evolved into a Frankenstein of colourful buttons, inconsistent layouts, and awkward flows. Making things worse, each developer handled their own platform in their own way â€” which meant the UI across systems began to look.. same-same but different.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p>Logically, a full scale UI Kit will take months to develop. By a team of designers. But alas, I am the only designer in the department ðŸ˜†. So I need to scale it down to the essentials and the most reused, high impact components.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h4>Font</h4>
        <p>I started with the foundation, the font. Roboto, I choose you! It's checks all my requirements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Free (It's on Google Fonts)</li>
          <li>Versatile (comes in tons of weight options)</li>
          <li>Optimized for legibility on screens (it is built for Android)</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h4>Colours</h4>
        <p>The colours was pretty straightforward. I set a neutral colour for generic items like borders and fonts â€” the kind of things that should fade into the background. Each system already have their own logo (designed by your's truly ðŸ˜Ž), so I used their primary brand colours as the base. From there, I expanded and tweaked the palette as I built out each platform.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Icons</h4>
        <p>This is pretty straightforward. I use Google's Material Symbol straight from their Figma plugin. Since I'm already using Android's font, why not use their icons too. So far, it served me pretty damn well. Everything I need is there. No complaints. Job done.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Buttons & Input Fields</h4>
        <p>Buttons is buttons. I've made fancy buttons in the past (because I'm a designer) for a particular website and I regret making such a thing. For these internal systems, I keep it simple and unmistakable. A button that looks like a button. An input field that looks like an input field.</p>

          <p><em>Gutes design ist so wenig design wie mÃ¶glich.</em><br>Good design is as little design as possible.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Dan Lain-lain</h4>
        <p>I used the basic components â€” the atoms and molecules â€” as the foundation to design each platform. But of course, in a UI Kit, there's more than just buttons and inputs. We've got tabs, tables, menus, toggles, toastsâ€¦ whatever, and to write about it all, this page is gonna be very, very long. Good for SEO but bad for YOU.</p>
        <p>The others are added on as I build each platform. Missing a toggle? Throw one in. Missing a toast? Slot that in. A UI Kit is never static. It grows as the product grows. in fact, I just added segmented controls to it the other day. It's never truly done.</p>
