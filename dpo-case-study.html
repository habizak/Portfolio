      <h1>DPO Management System</h1>

      <section>
        <h3>The Gist</h3>
        <p>DPO International, a regional supply chain company, manages operations through a suite of internal platforms: POMS, DMS, WMS, SOMS, and CAPSUL. These tools supported departments like finance, procurement, sales, warehouse, and delivery. The CEO decided that these platforms needed a revamp with a more straightforward and simple flow and UI. This is where I step in because I, too, had an issue with the current UI (they're designed by developers ü§´).</p>
        <p>Timeline: 1 Month (Yes, everything in one month!)</p>
        <p>My Role: UI Designer</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The System</h3>
        <p>Before jumping into design, I work closely with the Business Analyst to understand (translate) the flow, which is in a more than 15 pages long Excel file.</p>
        <p>Basically the whole system is based on stages that starts from a customer order and ends in the final delivery.</p> 
        <img class="pop-image" src="img/mini-metro.jpg" alt="Mini Metro game interface showing train routes">
        <p>Imagine a customer order as a train. As it moves along the track it will stop at multiple stations (AKA management systems; POMS, SOMS, WMS, DMS) and picks up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Passengers:</strong> Information (customer name, address, SKUs, quantity, etc)</li>
          <li><strong>Cargo:</strong> Documents (customer invoices, delivery orders, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each platforms have several sections (some have 5 stages, some just 3 depending on the complexity).</p>
        <p>Once the train reaches the final station (delivery complete), it returns to the first station and the process begins again. This is a continuous loop that reflects the day-to-day operational rhythm of the company.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <img class="pop-image" src="img/the-problem.png" alt="Mini Metro game interface showing train routes">
        <ul>
          <li>The legacy UI was inconsistent, unintuitive, and visually outdated.</li>
          <li>Each platform had a different layout and interaction patterns.</li>
          <li>No shared components or design system across platforms.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>Since the users have been using the current system for a few years, I don't want to tear everything down and create something new. I came up with a structure that is familiar but improved.</p>
        <img class="pop-image" src="img/the-structure.jpg" alt="Mini Metro game interface showing train routes">
        <p>To simplify development and user training, I introduced a shared layout system across all platforms. Each system now uses a consistent structure made up of three page types; <strong>Listing / Details / Form</strong>.</p>
        <p>This consistency made it easier to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scale features across platforms</li>
          <li>Train users faster</li>
          <li>Reduce confusion when switching between systems</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="pop-image" src="img/page-types.jpg" alt="Mini Metro game interface showing train routes">
        <p>Of course, each system needs to be same-same but different. While the layout stayed consistent, I gave each platform its own colour scheme based on each system's logos ‚Äî helping users instantly recognise where they are without disrupting the shared structure.</p>
        <img class="pop-image" src="img/result.jpg" alt="Mini Metro game interface showing train routes">
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Final Result</h3>
        <p>Each system now uses a familiar three-page structure (Listing, Details, Form), styled with its own colour theme. Every button sits quietly in its rightful place ‚Äî no one's screaming for attention except when needed. The layout finally makes sense. It feels intuitive without trying too hard. So, is it all good now right? Right??</p>

        <h3>One  More Thing</h3>
        <p>You might be wondering:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the user research?‚Äù<br>
          ‚ÄúDid you benchmark against other apps?‚Äù<br>
          ‚ÄúIs the designer handsome?‚Äù</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Yes, it would be lovely if I had the time to do all that <em>and</em> look good while doing it üòå<br>
        But in this case, the problem was obvious ‚Äî and so was the solution.</p>
      
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Time constraint.</strong> I had to redesign five platforms in one month. That‚Äôs not a research phase ‚Äî that‚Äôs a triage mission.</li>
          <li><strong>The layout was a mess.</strong> I wasn‚Äôt trying to reinvent it, just put everything back where it made sense. Think of it as doing some <em>mise en place</em>. Or if you don‚Äôt cook ‚Äî a little <em>Marie Kondo-ing</em> of the UI.</li>
          <li><strong>The pattern was already familiar.</strong> The users were used to the flow ‚Äî I just cleaned it up and made it consistent.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <p>Let me give you a prime example: <strong>email.</strong><br>
        You start with an inbox which is <em>listing page.</em> Click an email ‚Äî that‚Äôs the <em>details</em> page. Click reply ‚Äî you‚Äôre in a <em>form</em>. Hit send ‚Äî done. Same pattern. Different context.
        </p>
      
        <p>I applied that same flow logic to the platforms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Listing ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Form</strong></li>
          <li>Familiar. Predictable. No learning curve.</li>
          <li>Just better aligned, better styled, and way easier to use.</li>
        </ul>
