      <h2>DPO Management System</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>The Gist</h3>
        <p>DPO International, a regional supply chain company, manages operations through a suite of internal platforms: POMS, DMS, WMS, SOMS, and CAPSUL. These tools supported departments like finance, procurement, sales, warehouse, and delivery. The CEO decided that these platforms needed a revamp with a more straightforward and simple flow and UI. This is where I step in because I, too, had an issue with the current UI (they're designed by developers 🤫).</p>
        <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1 Month (Yes, everything in one month!)<br><strong>My Role:</strong> UI Designer (I just do the UI because the requirements and flow have been set in stone)</p>
      </section>

        <h3>The System</h3>
        <p>Before jumping into design, I work closely with the Business Analyst to understand (translate) the flow, which is in a more than 15 pages long Excel file.</p>
        <p>Basically the whole system is based on stages that starts from a customer order and ends in the final delivery.</p> 
        <img src="img/mini-metro.png" alt="Mini Metro game interface showing train routes">
        <p>Imagine a customer order as a train. As it moves along the track it will stop at multiple stations (AKA management systems; POMS, SOMS, WMS, DMS) and picks up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Passengers:</strong> Information (customer name, address, SKUs, quantity, etc)</li>
          <li><strong>Cargo:</strong> Documents (customer invoices, delivery orders, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each platforms have several sections (some have 5 stages, some just 3 depending on the complexity).</p>
        <p>Once the train reaches the final station (delivery complete), it returns to the first station and the process begins again. This is a continuous loop that reflects the day-to-day operational rhythm of the company.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <img src="img/the-problem.png" alt="Mini Metro game interface showing train routes">
        <ul>
          <li>The legacy UI was inconsistent, unintuitive, and visually outdated.</li>
          <li>Each platform had a different layout and interaction patterns.</li>
          <li>No shared components or design system across platforms.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>Since the users have been using the current system for a few years, I don't want to tear everything down and create something new. I came up with a structure that is familiar but improved.</p>
        <img src="img/the-structure.png" alt="Mini Metro game interface showing train routes">
        <p>To simplify development and user training, I introduced a shared layout system across all platforms. Each system now uses a consistent structure made up of three page types; <strong>Listing / Details / Form</strong>.</p>
        <p>This consistency made it easier to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scale features across platforms</li>
          <li>Train users faster</li>
          <li>Reduce confusion when switching between systems</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/page-types.png" alt="Mini Metro game interface showing train routes">
        <p>Of course, each system needs to be same-same but different. While the layout stayed consistent, I gave each platform its own colour scheme based on each system's logos — helping users instantly recognise where they are without disrupting the shared structure.</p>

        <h3>Final Result</h3>
        <p>Each system now uses a familiar three-page structure (Listing, Details, Form), styled with its own colour theme. Every button sits quietly in its rightful place — no one's screaming for attention except when needed. The layout finally makes sense. It feels intuitive without trying too hard. So, is it all good now right? Right??</p>

        <h3>One  More Thing</h3>
        <p>You might be wondering:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Where’s the user research?”<br>
          “Did you benchmark against other apps?”<br>
          “Is the designer handsome?”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Yes, it would be lovely if I had the time to do all that <em>and</em> look good while doing it 😌<br>
        But in this case, the problem was obvious — and so was the solution.</p>
      
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Time constraint.</strong> I had to redesign five platforms in one month. That’s not a research phase — that’s a triage mission.</li>
          <li><strong>The layout was a mess.</strong> I wasn’t trying to reinvent it, just put everything back where it made sense. Think of it as doing some <em>mise en place</em>. Or if you don’t cook — a little <em>Marie Kondo-ing</em> of the UI.</li>
          <li><strong>The pattern was already familiar.</strong> The users were used to the flow — I just cleaned it up and made it consistent.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <p>Let me give you a prime example: <strong>email.</strong><br>
        You start with an inbox (listing page). Click an email — that’s the <em>details</em> page. Click reply — you’re in a <em>form</em>. Hit send — done. Same pattern. Different context.
        </p>
      
        <p>I applied that same flow logic to the platforms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Listing → Details → Form</strong></li>
          <li>Familiar. Predictable. No learning curve.</li>
          <li>Just better aligned, better styled, and way easier to use.</li>
        </ul>
