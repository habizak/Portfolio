      <h2>DPO Management System</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>The Gist</h3>
        <p>DPO International, a regional supply chain company, manages operations through a suite of internal platforms: POMS, DMS, WMS, SOMS, and CAPSUL. These tools supported departments like finance, procurement, sales, warehouse, and delivery. The CEO decided that these platforms needed a revamp with a more straightforward and simple flow and UI. This is where I step in because I, too, had an issue with the current UI (they're designed by developers ðŸ¤«).</p>
        <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1 Month (Yes, everything in one month!)<br><strong>My Role:</strong> UI Designer (I just do the UI because the requirements and flow have been set in stone)</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The System</h3>
        <p>Before jumping into design, I work closely with the Business Analyst to understand (translate) the flow, which is in a more than 15 pages long Excel file.</p>
        <p>The whole system is based on stages that start from a customer order and ends in the final delivery. Imagine a customer order as a train. As it moves along the track it will stop at multiple stations (AKA management systems; POMS, SOMS, WMS, DMS) and picks up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Passengers:</strong> Information (customer name, address, SKUs, quantity, etc)</li>
          <li><strong>Cargo:</strong> Documents (customer invoices, delivery orders, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each platform has several sections (some have 5 stages, some just 3 depending on the complexity).</p>
      </section>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The legacy UI was inconsistent, unintuitive, and visually outdated.</li>
          <li>Each platform had a different layout and interaction patterns.</li>
          <li>No shared components or design system across platforms.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>Since the users have been using the current system for a few years, I didn't want to tear everything down and create something new. I came up with a structure that is familiar but improved.</p>
        <p>To simplify development and user training, I introduced a shared layout system across all platforms. Each system now uses a consistent structure made up of three page types: <strong>Listing / Details / Form</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Train users faster</li>
          <li>Reduce confusion when switching between systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, each system needs to be same-same but different. While the layout stayed consistent, I gave each platform its own colour scheme based on each system's logo â€” helping users instantly recognise where they are without disrupting the shared structure.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Final Result</h3>
        <p>Each system now uses a familiar three-page structure (Listing, Details, Form), styled with its own colour theme. Every button sits quietly in its rightful place â€” no one's screaming for attention except when needed. The layout finally makes sense. It feels intuitive without trying too hard. So, is it all good now right? Right??</p>
